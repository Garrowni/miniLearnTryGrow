What is the difference between a config map and a secret?
They both store data that your pod/app/deployments can access at a later time....
How are they different?
config map is for non-senesative data
Secrets are for sensitive data!

# What is a ConfigMap?
data will go right into etcd.

1. you make a config map (yaml file)
    - put all the details you need from k8 docs
2. use kubectl to apply the config map on the cluster
3. config map is created, at the same time API server saves this info in etcd.

If hacker is trying to steal your stuff and has gained access to you k8 cluster he could go run describe config map and get the info in it. He could alsso go to etcd and do the same.


# What is a Secret  
- Any kind of data put in secret will be encrypted "in Rest" before going into etcd
- RBAC --> you could say only devops gets access to srets
- You can also use a custom encryption
- whenever using secrets you should have very strong RBAC (use least privilege like with IAM!)

# Practicals

## Config Map
1. Create a config map called `cm.yml`
2. put an extremely basic config in there. For example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-cm
data:
  db-port: "3306"

```
3. run `kubectl apply -f cm.yml` --> apply the config map
4. run `kubectl get cm` --> get a list of config maps
5. run `kubectl describe cm test-cm` --> get details of the cm
6. go back into your deployment config (deployment.yml)
7. in container spec add a block to get the env var
```
      containers:
      - name: python-app
        image: ngarrow/python-app:latest
        env:
          - name: DB-PORT #what your going to use to call it
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:   
                name: test-cm #name you gave the config map
                key: db-port  # key thats in data in the config map
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```
8. run `kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml` --> apply the change
9. run `kubectl exec -it sample-python-app-<podstuff> -- /bin/bash`
10. from in the node run `env | grep -i db` --> this will output the env var yay!
